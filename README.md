Hi, my name is Madi Hamilton. I'm a first-year MURP concentrating in Transportation Policy and Planning, but I'm also really interested in food deserts and the concept of indigeneity among Hawaiians today (so counter mapping is also a new interest).

I'm hoping to really hone my python and GIS skills this quarter. In addition to helping me produce stronger GIS dashboards and datasets, I'm hoping I can apply these skills to research down the line.

So far, my project ideas include comparing the spatial extent of food distribution resources (in food deserts) and measures of health and economic well-being. The Park's Skid Row People's Market is a great example of providing a reliable source for fresh food in a food desert, but not all distribution systems operate with the same level of clarity and trust with the community. There can be lots of hoops to jump through and uncertainty through obtaining food from a pantry, church, or nonprofit. Therefore, looking out the outcomes of those close by could provide some insight on what works and what doesn't in food deserts.
